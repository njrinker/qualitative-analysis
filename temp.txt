"Working on projects I see are successful at doing something positive. When I have done this for MBF in Africa and Pakistan, it was very rewarding. Somewhat harder from the USA just giving money."\r\nSeeing in person the results of the charitable giving\r\n"It\'s difficult to pick a favorite, but certainly my experience with MBF has been pleasant and favorable."\r\nI loved receiving the Christmas cards from MBF after giving a donation online. It was quick and easy and I was able to send each person a beautiful Christmas card with the donation information in it. And then those people got to understand more about the gift by going to the website. It was great!\r\nGiving a lump sum to my church to help a specific ministry in need.\r\nThe 
comfort in knowing that we are helping those less fortunate then us.\r\nI think updates or tangible results of giving are so rewarding. I love donating to charitable organizations for pediatric oncology and see how the money 
is used to help those patients.\r\n"For a friend\'s birthday, she asked us to donate to a local homeless shelter in lieu of gifts. I found that meaningful and enjoyed that more than buying a gift for her."\r\n"My favorite charitable experience is donating money, to provide for people to have experiences that they may not otherwise have because they do not have the money to do so. I like knowing that it is available to them to further their education, or just have fun. No one should be denied the opportunity to have new experiences."\r\nMy favorite experience was supporting a child in another country and then being able to meet that child when I went on a mission trip there.\r\n"My favorite has been to Friends of Kids with Cancer. They are an organization that provides gift cards, experiences, support, toys, etc for kids who are fighting cancer"\r\n"My favorite charitable giving experience is when we did a Christmas drive for underprivlidged children. We were able to donate money and/or bikes, clothing, toys, etc. We then contributed our time to go and help wrap presents."\r\n"I think our sponsorship of a child through World Vision has been the most meaningful, because of the impact it has on the child and her family"\r\n"Being able to do a Foster kid party each December with my husband playing Santa and me as Mrs Clause. We gift the children gifts through a local organization and we get to watch all the kids react and foster parents feel supported and loved. Its incredible! We also get our children involved by doing crafts, playing elves and making 
cookies with the kids."\r\n"Several years ago, we donated a playground for special needs children in honor of our daughter who had special needs and passed away. That was probably the most fulfilling donation and my favorite."\r\nI love giving especially when I see a personal impact\r\nI often give to Hope House and Nspire which are two of my favorite charities due to homeless women and children being their core recipients of my donations.\r\n"My favorite charitable giving experience has always been giving to the salvation army. The salvation army is a charitable organization near and dear to my heart as I received financial support for college donation from the organization. Since then I look forward to supporting the organization and with Christmas being my favorite, most nostalgic time of the year. I eagerly look forward to seeing the salvation army bell ringers to kick off the season. I also enjoy the fact that members of my local community are often volunteering time to be guest bell ringers."\r\nI have enjoyed making donations through the African Well Fund which builds wells across Africa since that takes care of a tangible need.\r\n"Earlier this year my husband and I bought tickets to our local library\'s fundraiser. it was a great chance to get dressed up and celebrate reading at one of our libraries. While we were there, we also donated more for a raffle - but didn\'t win. We had a great night."\r\n"Providing Christmas toys to kids in low to very low income communities; and when I say toys, not those from dollar tree or stores like those but items I would buy for my children."\r\n"The feeling you get knowing that you are helping others. I think in todays world, it is important to give to others that may need a helping hand for whatever reason. I feel it is not 
for us to judge others, but to help others without knowing the why."\r\n"My favorite has been to ALS research. One of my best friends has the disease and is at the end of her life but in the 2 years since diagnosis, she has been an amazing example of grace and courage. She participated in a walk for ALS to raise money and she raised over $20,000 in personal donations and walked 5 miles with a brace on one leg as she was losing the use of one of her legs at the time. As she struggled to find meaning in why this disease is happening to her, my response was to stop searching for meaning ... it is all in how you handle it and the example you show for your kids that will 
last a lifetime."\r\n'
